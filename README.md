# StringQueue
Experimental package in go for learning purpose

### Note

- golang does not auto-install packages from url when import (treat all imports as relative path / standard libraries)

- should do ```go get github.com/Skycocoo/StringQueue``` before import remote packages in program like ```import "github.com/Skycocoo/StringQueue"```
